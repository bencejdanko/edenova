# Edenova


## Dependencies

Initiated with the `react-native-reusables` template. see [this link](https://rnr-docs.vercel.app/getting-started/introduction/) for documentation. 

Comes prebuilt with NativeWind and darkmode capacilities. If your NativeWind is not being rendered, be sure to add your files to `content` in `tailwind.config.js`.

SVGs are rendered using `react-native-svg-transformer`, which also requires changes in the metro config.
